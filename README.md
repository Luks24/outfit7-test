# Experience test

### Description

This project is a test I got assigned to do. 
My task was to create a simple server application that will be deployed on GCP in multiple regions.
The app had to be containerized and I also had to build a CI/CD pipeline that will automaticly deploy a new version of the app on GCP.
I also had to follow the principal of IaC.

I choose a python app and google run as the service to run my app. For CI/CD I used GitHub Actions.

In the coming sections I will describe step by step how you can make this project work.
